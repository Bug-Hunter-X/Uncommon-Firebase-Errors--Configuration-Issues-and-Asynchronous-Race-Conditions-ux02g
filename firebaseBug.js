The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided configuration is invalid, such as missing API keys or incorrect database URLs. This can be difficult to debug as the error message might not always point to the exact cause.  Another issue involves race conditions when using multiple asynchronous Firebase operations. Without proper synchronization, one operation might overwrite or interfere with another, leading to unpredictable behavior and data inconsistencies.
