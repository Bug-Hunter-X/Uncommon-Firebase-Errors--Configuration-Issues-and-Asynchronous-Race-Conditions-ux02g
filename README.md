# Uncommon Firebase Errors

This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors that can occur when using the Firebase JavaScript SDK:

1. **Invalid Configuration:** The Firebase SDK might throw cryptic errors if the configuration is incorrect.  This example shows how a missing API key can cause unexpected issues.
2. **Asynchronous Race Conditions:** This example highlights data inconsistencies that can arise from unsynchronized asynchronous operations, like writing to the database concurrently without proper handling.
