To solve the configuration issue, double-check your `firebase.json` and make sure all necessary API keys, database URLs, and other settings are correctly populated and that you are using the correct environment configuration. To handle asynchronous race conditions, utilize Firebase's built-in transaction capabilities for atomic database operations.  Promises and async/await can help manage the order of asynchronous operations more effectively.  Consider adding error handling and logging to more easily detect and diagnose such issues.
